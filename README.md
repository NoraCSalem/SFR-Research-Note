# SFR-Research-Note
This project analyzes the results of this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04854) on HI rich but low star forming galaxies by checking how different star formation rate (SFR) indicators affects the sample population. The original paper uses IR-indicated SFR as a threshold for low star forming galaxies, so this project follows up by graphically and statistically analyzing how changing SFR indicator will affect the sample population. 

Graphical results show significant discrepancies between different SFR indicators, with a substantial number of galaxies being star forming in one indicator but non star forming in another. However, running statistical tests show that p-values of other SFR indicators to the paper's chosen IR SFR indicator do not have significant differences.
