# SFR-Research-Note
This project analyzes the results of this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04854) on HI rich but low star forming galaxies by checking how different star formation rate (SFR) indicators affects the sample population. The original paper uses IR-indicated SFR as a threshold for low star forming galaxies, I follow up by graphically and statistically analyzing how changing SFR indicator will affect the sample population. 

Graphical results show significant discrepancies between different SFR indicators, with a substantial number of galaxies being star forming in one indicator but non star forming in another. However, running statistical tests show that p-values of other SFR indicators to the paper's chosen IR SFR indicator do not have significant differences. 

I get the data files from 
1) SDSS data files: SDSS17Pipe3D_v3_1_1, mangaHIall, dapall.
2) GSWLC data files: GSWLC-X2
3) WISE data file: MPL11_WISE
